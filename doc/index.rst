Creating a Python Package
=========================

Getting started creating a Python package is very simple. Your project
only needs two files, and a directory.

.. sidebar:: Module vs. Package

    A Python *module* is any file with Python code in it.
    A Python *package* has multiple Python modules.
    A package has a ``__init__.py`` file in a directory of Python modules.

Once you've got your package started, you can expand on it and add more
features, testing, documentation, and more.

This documentation shows how to build a modern Python package. If you
already have a package and want to know what each file does, see
:ref:`example-directory-tree`.

The official documentation for creating a Python package is at:

http://packaging.python.org
